<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Laura. I am an educator and fellow yoga teacher in the Ottawa area.<br>
  <br>
  I created this website to practice and play around with HTML and CSS, but also to bring awareness to the practice of yoga and local studios in my area.<br>
  <br>
  With COVID affecting small businesses and local studio owners, it is more important than ever to support them in any way possible. Even if it's only by creating this site and sharing their respective offerings and websites!
