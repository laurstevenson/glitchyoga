      <p>
        Vinyasa yoga is characterized by linking a series of postures together.<br>
        Think of it as a moving meditation, it is all about harmony and balance, grace and fluidity. We move and notice how we are moving and what moves us.

      <p>
        Hatha yoga is a branch of yoga. What makes this different from vinyasa yoga?<br> 
        The pacing of the sequences. Because the pace of this style of practice is slower, and poses are held for longer, it allows for more stretching in each shape, challenging your strength and flexibility while at the same time focusing on relaxation and mindfulness.
